<h1>The state tool</h1>

<p>The state tool, represented by a red circle in the toolbar, allows
you to add states the automaton. After selecting it, you can add states
by clicking on the canvas where you want to place the center of the
state.</p>

<p>You can also move states with the state tool by dragging a state from
its current location to another location.</p>

<p>For initial or final states, you should also designate the states as
initial or final. To do this, right-click (or command-click) on a state;
a menu will pop down where you can check or uncheck whether the state is
initial or final. (You can bring this menu up regardless of your current
tool.)</p>

<p>To delete a state, right-click (or command-click) it and select
Delete from the popup menu.</p>
