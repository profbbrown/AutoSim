<h1>The transition tool</h1>

<p>The transition tool, represented by a line connecting two red
circles in the toolbar, allows you to add transitions between states
of the automaton. After selecting it, you can add a transition
connecting two states by dragging from the start state to the
destination state. If the transition is to be a self-loop, just click on
the state.</p>

<p>You can also bend states with the state tool by dragging a state from
its current location to another location.</p>

<p>After you create a state, you'll want to designate to what letters
it applies. Right-click on the transition, and check the letters.</p>

<p>To delete a transition, right-click (or command-click) it and select
Delete from the popup menu.</p>
