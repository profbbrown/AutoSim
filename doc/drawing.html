<h1>Drawing an automaton</h1>

<ol>

<li>Start with a blank, new automaton by choosing from the New submenu
of the File menu. Automaton Simulator will allow you to create
four types of machines: a deterministic finite automaton, a
nondeterministic finite automaton, a deterministic push-down automaton,
or a Turing machine. This short tutorial applies to finite automata
only.</p>

<li>Select the <a href=state-tool.html>state tool</a>, pictured in the
toolbar as a large red circle. Place the states on the canvas where you
think they should go. Designate initial and final states by
right-clicking (or command-clicking) the states.</p>

<li>Draw transitions between states using the <a
href=transition-tool.html>transition tool</a>, pictured in the toolbar
as a line connecting two small red circles. Designate to which
letters the transitions apply by right-clicking (or command-clicking)
the transitions.</p>

<li>To simulate the automaton on a string, click the <a
href=simulate-button.html>simulate button</a> (pictured as a green
right-pointing triangle). Now type the characters of
the string. As you type, the current state of the automaton will
update.</p>

<p>To start a new string, click the button again.</p>

</ol>
